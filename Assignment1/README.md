## 🌟 Introduction
This project aims to explore and analyze the factors affecting students' academic performance. We will be using machine learning techniques to understand these factors and predict a student's academic performance based on them.

Honestly Datarobot worked better than Jadbio

## 📝 Task Description
The task for this assignment comes from Kaggle's Student Performance Dataset. The dataset is designed to examine the factors influencing academic student performance. It comprises 10,000 student records, with each record containing various predictors and a performance index.

---

## 🔍 Variables
The dataset consists of the following variables:

- **⏳ Hours Studied:** The total number of hours spent studying by each student.
- **📝 Previous Scores:** The scores obtained by students in previous tests.
- **🏃‍♀️ Extracurricular Activities:** Whether the student participates in extracurricular activities (Yes or No).
- **🛌 Sleep Hours:** The average number of hours of sleep the student had per day.
- **📄 Sample Question Papers Practiced:** The number of sample question papers the student practiced.

---

## 🎯 Target Variable
The target variable is:

- **📊 Performance Index:** A measure of the overall performance of each student. The performance index represents the student's academic performance and has been rounded to the nearest integer. The index ranges from 10 to 100, with higher values indicating better performance.
